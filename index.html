                1) By far this is one of my best trips in anywhere in this world and in this lifetime. The beauty of
                snow, mountain and along with that, the struggle of trekking at the end of the day makes you a better
                person and also make you think for the environment hich we all should do to save it.

                2) Kedarkantha is one of the finest Moderate treks of Uttarkand, magnificient trail, splendid scenic
                beauty, mind blowing fauna. It just sinks into you in no time. one gets withdrawal symptoms for weeks
                after the visit. But what remains an important point is that never book this trek with amateur tour
                operators.

                We did grave mistake of booking the trek with an operator called Crazy Peaks. They ensured we went
                crazier day by day and at the end of the trek we were the craziest.
                3) Exquisite snow trails. A must for any trekker. One of my best treks ever. Do carry proper gear.

            4) It is perfect trek for beginners, can be done in 2-3 days only.
            It is easy to moderate trek.
            It starts from Sankri Village in uttarkashi district.
            It takes aroud 3 hours to reach at 1st camp site which can be Juda-Ka-Taal or Hargaon, both are at almost
            same altitude. It take next around 1.5 hours to reach Kedarkantha Base Camp, which can be done in same day
            easily.
            But it is advisable to stay at 1st camp site for beginners to get acclimatize properly and to avoid AMS.
            It takes 3-4 hours to reach summit point from base camp. It is high advisable to leave base camp by 3am in
            the morning to enjoy beautiful sunrise at top point.
            A mesmerizing sunrise is the key factor for this trek.
            It takes aroud 2 hours to reach base camp and it takes further 45min to reach hargaon and further 2 hours to
            reach sankri village.
            It is recommended not to stay at any camp while returning back, if you have reached at summit point by
            sunrise.
            It is charming only in snow, so best time is December to March.
            Carry heavy woolen for summit day trek, there should be high quality wind proof jacket.

    5) It was amazing experience with India hikes. Its an awesome winter trek. Experience snow fall and enjoyed. We
    didn't get the view point but snow fall was worth it

    6) The best part of kedarkantha is the night trek to reach the summit on the 3rd day. Avoid travelling with
    mainstream trek organiser.. the smaller the group the better Prep urself well for the one day bus ride from
    dehradhun to purole.. its painful. Yet rewarding Not one of…

    7) We trek starts from a small town named Sankri, Uttrakhand (6000 ft). Its a 3 day climb to the summit halting at
    1. Juda ka talaab (9600ft)
    2. Kedarkantha base camp (11200ft)

    This is a good place to start your trekking experience as it is a moderate level trek, even people aged 50 were seen
    to climb the summit (offloading their rucksack). The base camps are located in pretty good locations. Can lookout
    for the trek with teams like Renok Adventures, Himalayan Hikers etc.

    9) One of the best trekking destination for winter in India. Good for all.
    Every day is a new day in this trek and each step brings you more close to nature
    I did Kedarkantha trek with Moxtain. And believe me, they are good at what they are doing. A very dedicated staff
    that gives personalized attention and less environmental impact.
    If anyone ever asks me for trekking in the Himalayas, Go Moxtain!!

    10) This location is trekkers paradise. Very awesome location. Totally snow covered. It's trek starts from a small
    village named Sankri. The trek continue from Sankri to Juda Ka Talab then further Luhasu and the Kedarkantha. It is
    situated at the height of 12,500 feets. It's has a mind blowing view from the peak.
