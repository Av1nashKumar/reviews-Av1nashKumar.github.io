                1) By far this is one of my best trips in anywhere in this world and in this lifetime. The beauty of
                snow, mountain and along with that, the struggle of trekking at the end of the day makes you a better
                person and also make you think for the environment hich we all should do to save it.

            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                2) Kedarkantha is one of the finest Moderate treks of Uttarkand, magnificient trail, splendid scenic
                beauty, mind blowing fauna. It just sinks into you in no time. one gets withdrawal symptoms for weeks
                after the visit. But what remains an important point is that never book this trek with amateur tour
                operators.

                We did grave mistake of booking the trek with an operator called Crazy Peaks. They ensured we went
                crazier day by day and at the end of the trek we were the craziest.

            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
            3) Exquisite snow trails. A must for any trekker. One of my best treks ever. Do carry proper gear.
            </div>
            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                4) It is perfect trek for beginners, can be done in 2-3 days only.
                It is easy to moderate trek.
                It starts from Sankri Village in uttarkashi district.
                It takes aroud 3 hours to reach at 1st camp site which can be Juda-Ka-Taal or Hargaon, both are at
                almost
                same altitude. It take next around 1.5 hours to reach Kedarkantha Base Camp, which can be done in same
                day
                easily.
                But it is advisable to stay at 1st camp site for beginners to get acclimatize properly and to avoid AMS.
                It takes 3-4 hours to reach summit point from base camp. It is high advisable to leave base camp by 3am
                in
                the morning to enjoy beautiful sunrise at top point.
                A mesmerizing sunrise is the key factor for this trek.
                It takes aroud 2 hours to reach base camp and it takes further 45min to reach hargaon and further 2
                hours to
                reach sankri village.
                It is recommended not to stay at any camp while returning back, if you have reached at summit point by
                sunrise.
                It is charming only in snow, so best time is December to March.
                Carry heavy woolen for summit day trek, there should be high quality wind proof jacket.

                5) It was amazing experience with India hikes. Its an awesome winter trek. Experience snow fall and
                enjoyed. We
                didn't get the view point but snow fall was worth it
            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                6) The best part of kedarkantha is the night trek to reach the summit on the 3rd day. Avoid travelling
                with
                mainstream trek organiser.. the smaller the group the better Prep urself well for the one day bus ride
                from
                dehradhun to purole.. its painful. Yet rewarding Not one of…
            </div>


            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                7) We trek starts from a small town named Sankri, Uttrakhand (6000 ft). Its a 3 day climb to the summit
                halting at
                1. Juda ka talaab (9600ft)
                2. Kedarkantha base camp (11200ft)

                This is a good place to start your trekking experience as it is a moderate level trek, even people aged
                50 were seen
                to climb the summit (offloading their rucksack). The base camps are located in pretty good locations.
                Can lookout
                for the trek with teams like Renok Adventures, Himalayan Hikers etc.

                9) One of the best trekking destination for winter in India. Good for all.
                Every day is a new day in this trek and each step brings you more close to nature
                I did Kedarkantha trek with Moxtain. And believe me, they are good at what they are doing. A very
                dedicated staff
                that gives personalized attention and less environmental impact.
                If anyone ever asks me for trekking in the Himalayas, Go Moxtain!!

            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                10) This location is trekkers paradise. Very awesome location. Totally snow covered. It's trek starts
                from a small
                village named Sankri. The trek continue from Sankri to Juda Ka Talab then further Luhasu and the
                Kedarkantha. It is
                situated at the height of 12,500 feets. It's has a mind blowing view from the peak.

                11) One of the best trek to enjoy different shades of nature and different types of climate in a duration of 6 days. supporting guides and well organized trek. The mesmerizing breath taking views of greater Himalayas gives the best experience for lifetime
            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                12) Kedarkantha trek was an eye-opener to me. For the first time I got to witness the majestic beauty of the Garhwal Himalayas through this trek. Also as it was an easy hike, I was more comfortable and had plenty of times to admire the beauty around. And yeah, this is among the easy treks in Uttarakhand and is best enjoyed during the winters only. All thanks to the organisers, trek guides and the supporting staff for such a brilliant experience.
            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                13) even the drive after our arrival was so beautiful. this region really possess a lot to explore and with Kedarkantha winter trek, I think we were able to enjoy most of it. thanks to the trek guides for assisting us so nicely while trekking. it would not have been possible without the your guidance.
            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                14) Spent amazing times with the Kedarkantha winter trek last year. I being new to this region, found the Kedarkantha trek pretty exciting and fabulous. Hope, next time I go for it will also be the same. Loved it so much.
            </div>


            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                15) From the trek to all the arrangements made by the organisers were too good. From the first day to the last day of the trek, we had amazing moments; especially on the third day. On that day, the hikes were really fascinating and took us through some of the best parts of Kedarkantha trekking.
            </div>



            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                16) While on the trek to Kedarkantha, every single moment was full of excellent views, memorable experiences and hell lot of fun. The terrains were easy to access and do not require much effort. But yeah, temperature might fluctuate a bit. Keep a track on how to pack for this trek. Rest is all good to go.
            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                17) A must for the beginners! I personally liked it and hope everyone would like it as well. No such challenges or difficulties on the trek to Kedarkantha. Make sure your organisers are experienced enough and gives you all the info about the trek beforehand. I had a perfect trekking experience with this organiser and would also like to recommend them for all.
            </div>


            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                18) We ate like pigs to stay energized for the trek, and all I remember is trudging up endless peaks after that, and not feeling tired for even one second as the landscape simply keeps you stunned! The Gangotri ranges are a whole new revelation and I recommend this trek for all young adventurers!
            </div>


            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                19) The trek from Juda ka Talab to Kedarkantha base was truly challenging as it took us almost 7 hours and the terrains were really jagged and steep. We are not professional trekkers but we have done this multiple times and we had a blast here, both in the mental sense and physically too! We were tired by the end of it, but we felt that it was worth every second spent, as well as the money!
            </div>


            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
            20) Visited so many places and got to trek atop one of the most amazing mountains in India! There are so many surprises and wonders here that you just feel that 6 days are not enough! Will go again for sure!
